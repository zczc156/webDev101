    File route?

    HTML file route starts at the current working directory
    which means the directory that the HTML file is located
    ./ means the current working directory
    ../ means the parent directory

    alt -> Text which shows up when img is not available
    src and alt are attributes that should be included in all img tags

    Using width and height attributes at the same time can detroy img's proportion

    img tag can be included inside a tag
